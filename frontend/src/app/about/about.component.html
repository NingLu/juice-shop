      <p class="text-justify">
        Sensitive Data Protection on Amazon Web Services is a solution that aims to help enterprises to automate the sensitive data discovery process and manage data assets on a single platform. This solution provides a web application capable of discovering and managing sensitive data across multiple Amazon Web Services accounts.

By using this solution, customers can achieve improved data security, compliance, and data management. The solution allows customers to create data catalogs, define sensitive data using built-in or customized data identification rules, and scan the data source (Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS) using a classification template. After the scan, customers can have an overview of their data assets and browse the data at the column level to understand where the data is, what it is, and its sensitivity levels. With this information, customers can take appropriate actions to secure sensitive data and comply with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PIPL.

Sensitive Data Protection on Amazon Web Services uses Amazon Glue Data Catalog, Amazon Glue Crawler, and the Amazon Glue PII Detection feature as key components to produce data catalogs and perform sensitive data discovery jobs for each Amazon Web Services account. It centralizes information such as data catalogs and data discovery results in a single place and provides a dashboard and detailed reports, making it easier for customers to manage their sensitive data protection efforts.
